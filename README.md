# CubeSat-prototype
Design, Build and test
###### STR: Structure, EPS: Electrical power Subsystem, CDH: Command data and handling, COM: Communications, ADC: Attitude Determination and Control, GCS: Ground Control Station
#### The purpose of this project is to develop the prototype of a CubeSat 1U type satellite, used in real space missions. 
#### 6 subsystems and a Ground control station were designed: EPS, Payload, CDH, COM, ADC, GCS and STR.
#### each subsystem was designed, built and tested
#### Communication protocols used: UART, I2C, Analog, SPI, Zigbee
